				It is a Role Playing Game combined with Turn-based strategic movements and battles. 
				It has two different modes as Map-mode and War-mode. The ultimate goals are 
				finding some valuable items, fighting with the enemies and conquer the factions' cities 
				on the map in the end.

				</ul>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<h4>Cover Design</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Tone / Light:</u></li>
						We can see the cover inspired with the incident control. There is a bright
						light at the back of the character; the character's and the city's color tones
						are determined by this lights. Also the character is in coincidence of tone.
					<li><u>Color:</u></li>
						There are three main colors in the cover: Yellow, Blue and Green. It is an
						analogic color scheme because this three colors are neinghbors on the 
						color wheel.
					<li><u>Space / Screen Division:</u></li>
						There is a 1:1 Vertical Ratio between the main character and background of
						the cover.
					<li><u>Placement</u></li>
						There is golden ratio between the character's head including torso and 
						the whole cover.
					<li><u>Movement:</u></li>
						There is a latin cross figure on the character's helmet, so it attracts 
						attention to that area. Also the city's towers are very sharp and point to
						the name of the game.
					<li><u>Font:</u></li>
						The name of the game is written with a metalic grey and yellow font.
						Its number is written in Roman numeral type.
					<li><u>Emphasis:</u></li>
						It is on the main character on the cover's right hand side.
					<li><u>Unity:</u></li>
						The character on the cover looks like a holy knight from a fantasy world,
						and in the background there is a flying beast on the sky and the city is not
						structured as today's buildings, so there is very good bond and unity between
						the character and the whole cover's story.
					<li><u>Mood:</u></li>
						The character is looking to the camera, hence he has a demand mood.
					<li><u>Figure / Ground:</u></li>
						The character distinguishly seperated from the background with perspective,
						diffusion and focus differences.
					<li><u>Distance:</u></li>
						We are in the personal distance of the character on the cover.
					<li><u>Framing:</u></li>
						It is between medium and medium full shot.
					<li><u>Camera Angle:</u></li>
						It is a subjective camera angle and the character looks to the camera from
						straight on angle.
					<li><u>Symbolic Meanings:</u></li>
						The character is between the center and margin.
