				<p>Heroes of Might and Magic V (sometimes referred to as Heroes V or HoMM5) is the fifth installment 
				of the Heroes of Might and Magic fantasy turn-based strategy video game series. Like the other games 
				in the series, players control "heroes" -leaders with magical abilities- who recruit forces -often monsters- from 
				strongholds such as castles. The heroes and their armies battle the opponents, who also use heroes to lead their forces. 
				It features a campaign series of levels, stand-alone and multiplayer scenarios.</p>
				<p>A hero can learn a new skill, upgrade an existing one, gain a new ability or create combos of multiple abilities upon 
				gaining a new level or visiting special buildings on the adventure map. There are two sets of skills available to heroes: 
				racial skills and regular skills. A hero can have up to five regular skills and always has the proper racial skill. Skills 
				are divided into four levels: Basic, Advanced, Expert, and Ultimate. Each skill is associated with three to five abilities, 
				depending on the race of the hero. Each level of skill gives the hero a chance to learn one ability under the skill. That is, 
				a hero with Basic level of a skill can learn one ability, Advanced level two, and Expert level three. An ability is not immediately 
				learned when the hero increases the corresponding skill level.</p>
				<p>The racial skill that a hero learns is dependent on their native faction. All heroes from a faction learn the same racial skill and
				racial abilities. Each racial skill culminates in an 'ultimate ability' that can only be gained by learning a very specific 
				set of regular skills and abilities. In addition to the three levels of skills that apply to regular skills, the racial skill 
				can reach an ultimate level when a certain artifact is worn by the hero.</p>
				<p>It has two different modes as Map-mode and War-mode.</p>

						and so on with the other factions. The bad factions have less lighting than the good factions.

				<h4>Cover Design</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><u>Tone / Light:</u></li>
						We can see the cover inspired with the incident control. There is a bright
						light at the back of the character; the character's and the city's color tones
						are determined by this lights. Also the character is in coincidence of tone.
					<li><u>Color:</u></li>
						There are three main colors in the cover: Yellow, Blue and Green. It is an
						analogic color scheme because this three colors are neinghbors on the 
						color wheel.
					<li><u>Space / Screen Division:</u></li>
						There is a 1:1 Vertical Ratio between the main character and background of
						the cover.
					<li><u>Placement</u></li>
						There is golden ratio between the character's head including torso and 
						the whole cover.
					<li><u>Movement:</u></li>
						There is a latin cross figure on the character's helmet, so it attracts 
						attention to that area. Also the city's towers are very sharp and point to
						the name of the game.
					<li><u>Font:</u></li>
						The name of the game is written with a metalic grey and yellow font.
						Its number is written in Roman numeral type.
					<li><u>Emphasis:</u></li>
						It is on the main character on the cover's right hand side.
					<li><u>Unity:</u></li>
						The character on the cover looks like a holy knight from a fantasy world,
						and in the background there is a flying beast on the sky and the city is not
						structured as today's buildings, so there is very good bond and unity between
						the character and the whole cover's story.
					<li><u>Mood:</u></li>
						The character is looking to the camera, hence he has a demand mood.
					<li><u>Figure / Ground:</u></li>
						The character distinguishly seperated from the background with perspective,
						diffusion and focus differences.
					<li><u>Distance:</u></li>
						We are in the personal distance of the character on the cover.
					<li><u>Framing:</u></li>
						It is between medium and medium full shot.
					<li><u>Camera Angle:</u></li>
						It is a subjective camera angle and the character looks to the camera from
						straight on angle.
					<li><u>Symbolic Meanings:</u></li>
						The character is between the center and margin.
